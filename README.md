# RiftDK2SensorLogger

Basic tool for logging sensor data from Oculus Rift DK2 HMD. 

Written to support my final year project (3D telepresence with the Oculus Rift), in order to get a feel for what rates the user is likely to move their head at while looking around (during different tasks / environments).
